# Shopify-AMP-Theme
This is the first and only working Shopify theme to provide a fully Google AMP compatible website template, allowing merchants to create online stores which are consistently high-performing, fast and beautiful across many different devices and distribution platforms.

# Problem
Most e-commerce websites, including those made using Shopify, are poorly optimised for the mobile experience. Issues such as render-blocking JavaScript/CSS as well as non-optimised images detract from the user’s impression of an online store. This decreases user engagement and might drive away potential customers. Furthermore, failure to implement techniques such as visible content prioritisation and leveraged browser caching results in webpages loading very slowly. These long loading times can cause irritation and frustration for the user, further decreasing their satisfaction and likelihood of engagement. 

# Google AMP
Google AMP certified websites have rapid loading speeds because their content is cached using Google’s servers. This means that webpages published in the AMP format load instantly, providing users with a smooth and engaging experience for both mobile and desktop. 

AMP enabled websites will show an “AMP” or flash logo in Google search results for mobile devices. More details in https://www.ampproject.org/

Implementation of AMP has been proven to increase conversions and decrease bounce rates for all types of business, including e-commerce. Introducing AMP websites would provide Shopify merchants with a competitive advantage over other online stores by improving mobile experience and loading times. Below are some case study examples of e-commerce merchants which have benefited from AMP implementation: 
•	Fastcommerce, page speed increased by 2.5x and mobile conversion rates increased by 15% (Jun 2017).
•	Greenweez, the leading French organic retailer, improved page speeds by 5x, increased mobile conversion rates by 80%, and decreased mobile acquisition costs by 66% (Jun 2017). 
•	Wego.com, has seen page speeds increased by 10x, partner conversion rates increase by 95%, search-to-conversion rates increased by 49%, as well as a 3x increase in Ad CTRs (May 2017). 
•	WompMobile, achieved a conversion rate increase of 105% and a decrease in bounce rate of 31% (Mar 2017). 

# Shopify with Google AMP
Although Google AMP increase conversions of Shopify shops. As I asked Shopify, they will NOT improve their platform to AMP in a short time due to technical issues. Some existing shopify apps convert blog or product pages into a seperate AMP page, but none of them can convert Home page.

Shopify-AMP-Theme makes impossible possible. Written from scratch using Google AMP, Shopify-AMP-Theme uses the same code for Desktop and Mobile, and is clearly structured with pure AMP and CSS. Shopify-AMP-Theme should be the first and only working Shopify theme, which is validated and cached by Google AMP.

Features include:
•	Pure CSS and AMP framework
•	Images dynamically loaded according to display size
•	JavaScript disabled to optimise loading speeds
•	Liquid language used to automatically transform user input HTML to AMP standard 
•	Simplified bootstrap and custom-designed CSS
•	High performance

# Development Plan
Version 0.1 has been completed and currently supports a single-product layout. We are working on supporting other popular layouts for Shopify merchants. 

# Testing Website
Our sample website is launched at https://www.babysocks.uk/. 

Searching "pure organic baby socks" in google, a list of our pages, including home page, product and blog will show up as Google AMP cached pages. Click on the links, and test our consistently fast, beautiful and high-performing theme across devices and distribution platforms.

You are more than welcome to test our theme performance in Google’s PageSpeed Insights (https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/).
